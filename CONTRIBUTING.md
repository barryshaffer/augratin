I'm a first time Python user so I could alway use a hand. 

I think I have a good path to injecting omnirig CAT control

But have not yet looked into LOG4OM functionality. Functionality I'm looking for is to populate the QSO information in LOG4OM when a line is selected in AUGRATIN. I'm suspecting some UDP messaging schema but not sure - any info examples would be welcome.
