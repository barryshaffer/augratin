# Objective:
Enhance Augratin by integrating a feature to broadcast POTA QSOs using UDP when the ‘log it’ button is activated.

# Approach:
Leveraging the UDP broadcasting method employed by WSJTX, a popular platform whose format is already compatible with various logging programs like HRD, we aim to ensure broader compatibility and ease of integration. By adopting this UDP format, we can avoid the complexities of TCP message streams from HRD, increasing the likelihood of seamless functionality with other logging applications, including those not yet considered.
